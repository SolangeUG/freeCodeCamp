## Basic Data Structures

> Data can be stored and accessed in many different ways, both in Javascript and other languages. This section will teach you how to manipulate arrays, as well as access and copy the information within them. It will also teach you how to manipulate and access the data within Javascript objects, using both dot and bracket notation. When you're done with this section, you should understand the basic properties and differences between arrays and objects, as well as how to choose which to use for a given purpose.

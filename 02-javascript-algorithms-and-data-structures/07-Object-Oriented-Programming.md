## Object-Oriented Programming

> The software development process first defines a problem, then presents a solution. Object oriented programming is one of several major approaches to the software development process.

> As its name implies, object oriented programming organizes code into object definitions. These are sometimes called classes, and they group together data with related behavior. The data is an object's attributes, and the behavior (or functions) are methods.

> Your choice of programming approach depends on a few factors. These include the type of problem, as well as how you want to structure your data and algorithms. This section covers object oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

- [Create a basic JavaScript object][1]
- [Use dot notation to access the properties of an object][2]
- [Create a method on an object][3]
- [Make code more reusable with the this keyword][4]
- [Define a constructor function][5]
- [Use a constructor to create objects][6]
- [Extend constructors to receive arguments][7]
- [Verify an object's constructor with instanceof][8]
- [Understand own properties][9]
- [Use prototype properties to reduce duplicate code][10]
- [Iterate over all properties][11]
- [Understand the constructor property][12]
- [Change the prototype to a new object][13]
- [Remember to set the constructor property when changing the prototype][14]
- [Understand where an object’s prototype comes from][15]
- [Understand the prototype chain][16]
- [Use inheritance so you don't repeat yourself][17]
- [Inherit behaviors from a supertype][18]
- [Set the child's prototype to an instance of the parent][19]
- [Reset an inherited constructor property][20]
- [Add methods after inheritance][21]
- [Override inherited methods][22]
- [Use a mixin to add common behavior between unrelated objects][23]
- [Use closure to protect properties within an object from being modified externally][24]
- [Understand the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)][25]
- [Use an IIFE to create a module][1]

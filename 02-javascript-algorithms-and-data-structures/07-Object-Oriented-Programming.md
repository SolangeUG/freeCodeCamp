## Object-Oriented Programming

> The software development process first defines a problem, then presents a solution. Object oriented programming is one of several major approaches to the software development process.

> As its name implies, object oriented programming organizes code into object definitions. These are sometimes called classes, and they group together data with related behavior. The data is an object's attributes, and the behavior (or functions) are methods.

> Your choice of programming approach depends on a few factors. These include the type of problem, as well as how you want to structure your data and algorithms. This section covers object oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

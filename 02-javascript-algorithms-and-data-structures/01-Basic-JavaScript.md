## Basic JavaScript

> JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support.
It is also one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously.
This section will cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.

#### Comment your JavaScript code
Create an `inline` comment, and a `multi-line` comment.

````JavaScript
// This is an inline comment

/*
 This is a multi-line comment.
 This has been an excercise on writing comments in JavaScript.
*/
````
----

#### Declare JavaScript variables
`Variable` names can be made up of numbers, letters, and `$` or `_`, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
Use the `var` keyword to create a variable called `myName`.

````JavaScript
// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this name
var myName;
````
----

#### Storing values with the assignment operator
Assign the value `7` to variable `a`. Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

````JavaScript
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;
````
----

#### Initializing variable with the assignment operator
Define a variable `a` with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`.

````JavaScript
// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Change code below this line
var a = 9;
````
----

#### Understanding uninitialized variables
Initialize the three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with `5`, `10`, and `"I am a"` respectively so that they will not be `undefined`.

````JavaScript
// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
````
----

#### Understanding case sensitivity in variables
Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use `camelCase`.
Do not create any new variables.

````JavaScript
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
````
----

#### Add two numbers with JavaScript
Change the `0` so that sum will equal `20`.

````JavaScript
// Add two numbers
var sum = 10 + 10;
````
----

#### Subtract one number from another with JavaScript
Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

````JavaScript
// Subtract two numbers
var difference = 45 - 33;
````
----

#### Multiply two numbers with JavaScript
Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.

````JavaScript
// Multiply two numbers
var product = 8 * 10;
````
----

#### Divide one number by another with JavaScript
Change the `0` so that quotient is equal to `2`.

````JavaScript
// Divide two numbers
var quotient = 66 / 33;
````
----

#### Increment a number with JavaScript
Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

````JavaScript
var myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
````
----

#### Decrement a number with JavaScript
Change the code to use the `--` operator on `myVar`.

````JavaScript
var myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;
````
----

#### Create decimal numbers with JavaScript
Create a variable `myDecimal` and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g.` 5.7`).

````JavaScript
var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 4.4;
````
----

#### Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript
Change the `0.0` so that product will equal `5.0`.

````JavaScript
// Decimal product
var product = 2.0 * 2.5;
````
----

#### Divide one decimal by another with JavaScript
Change the `0.0` so that quotient will equal to `2.2`.

````JavaScript
// Decimal quotient
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;
````
----

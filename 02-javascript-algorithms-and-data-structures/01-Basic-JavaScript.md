## Basic JavaScript

> JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support.
It is also one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously.
This section will cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.

#### Comment your JavaScript code
Create an `inline` comment, and a `multi-line` comment.

````JavaScript
// This is an inline comment

/*
 This is a multi-line comment.
 This has been an excercise on writing comments in JavaScript.
*/
````

#### Declare JavaScript Variables
`Variable` names can be made up of numbers, letters, and `$` or `_`, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
Use the `var` keyword to create a variable called `myName`.

````JavaScript
// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this name
var myName;
````
----

#### Storing Values with the Assignment operator
Assign the value `7` to variable `a`. Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

````JavaScript
// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;
````
----

#### Initializing variable with the assignment operator
Define a variable `a` with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`.

````JavaScript
// Example
var ourVar = 19;

// Change code below this line
var a = 9;
````

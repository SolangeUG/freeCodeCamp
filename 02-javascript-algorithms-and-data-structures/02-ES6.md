## ES6 Challenges

> `ECMAScript` is a standardized version of JavaScript with the goal of unifying the language's specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term `ECMAScript` is interchangeable with the term `JavaScript`.

> The most recent standardized version is called `ECMAScript 6` (`ES6`), released in 2015. This new version of the language adds some powerful features that will be covered in this section of challenges, including:
> - Arrow functions
> - Classes
> - Modules
> - Promises
> - Generators
> - `let` and `const`

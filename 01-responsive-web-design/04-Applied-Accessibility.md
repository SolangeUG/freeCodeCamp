## Applied Accessibility

> **Accessibility** generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources.

> Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web. Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:
> - have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
> - ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
> - create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly

> A great resource for your projects going forward is the [W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)][1]. They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.
